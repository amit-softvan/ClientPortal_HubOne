The current left panel occupies too much horizontal space on desktop web screens. To optimize screen real estate and improve usability, the left panel should be redesigned to display only icons by default. When the user hovers over the panel, it should expand to show the full menu names, and automatically collapse back to icons once the mouse pointer leaves the panel area.
This behavior should be applied only to the desktop web version. The mobile application should continue using the existing menu design without this hover-based interaction.
